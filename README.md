# SQL-portfolio

I have started this repository to demonstrate my SQL skills and progress going from a beginner to a pro. This will include projects that I have developed mainly using PostgreSQL.

I intend to have two files per project, one being the results of my findings and the other containing the code used to find it with a description of where I got the data from.
